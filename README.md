It is a dataset containing wine reviews published to Wine Enthusiast (Wine Enthusiast, or WE for short, is an American magazine that invites professional wine tasters to rate wines every year), including taster name, wine price, variety, score, country, county, vineyard, etc. There are a large number of red wine varieties and brands, and even the same region can have many different red wines. Accordingly, different tasters have tasted different wines. Perhaps even a taster can't taste all the wines. In order to improve efficiency and let the tasters taste a satisfactory wine, I would like to develop a content-based method to recommend wines among tasters. At the same time, I would like to make a recommendation system for recommending wines to people at different stages in the field(tasting wine).
